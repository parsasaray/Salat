# Salat — A Clean, Reliable Prayer Reminder App

This started as a simple personal tool.

Now it’s the go-to app for my entire community — and apparently the best one they’ve used.

No ads. No distractions. No unnecessary screens. Just a fast, accurate, and beautifully minimal prayer utility.

🛠️ Community-Built

Every feature came from real-world requests — group chats, late-night texts, and “can you add this real quick?” messages.
If you’ve got an idea, request it. If it helped you, share it with someone else. That’s how this grows.

✅ Final Thought

There are plenty of prayer apps. Most are bloated, confusing, or full of ads.
This one is different — built for people who just want something that works.
